Despite facing occasional difficulties during the implementation, the final code worked according to the specifications of the assignment text. We have learned a great deal about programming on microchips, in particular the STK1000 with the AVR32. When it comes to energy efficiency, our result is a program that will sleep most of the time and only do work when necessary, which is optimal. We also had time to implement some fancy features that make simple animations with the LEDs.
