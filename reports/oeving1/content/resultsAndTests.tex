This assignment’s stated task was to create an assembly program for the STK1000 that would turn on the central LED and allow a user to shift the light either left or right by pressing buttons that are read in an interrupt routine. Specifically, this required the light-switching to be placed in the main loop.

There was no formal test-environment for this assignment and the main manner of testing was to visually see if the buttons and LEDs behaved as they should. This meant whether the correct lights were turned on and on time, and were turned off correctly, and on time. Eventually the resulting program behaved satisfyingly to the group-members in terms of response-time as well as fulfilling the assignment’s requirements. At that point the program was deemed finished.


Choice of 0x55 enable LEDs thingy?
(The value of 0x55 was chosen as an easily recognizable pattern including all the LEDs, as we experienced random lights turning on during the run of invalid code. )
