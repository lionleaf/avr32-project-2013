Some discussion around the manner of the report between the students and the one in charge of the assignment may be prudent. The assignments do not seem to lend themselves very well to the stated format, and one risks falling into the trap of repeating things a lot: That is not good. It is a bad enough habit as it is that some people think that a good skeleton of a report is “say what you’re gonna say, say it and say what you’ve said”, without being shoved in such a direction for lack of proper material to put in the different report-slots.  I’m also inclined to say that a ‘results’ section is irrelevant as it is generally a place to report the results of tests and findings; something this assignment strictly speaking lacks(that is in a meaningful way).
