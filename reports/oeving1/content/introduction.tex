This assignments's stated task was to create an assebly program that would turn on the central LED on a given microcontroller, and then allow a user to move the light either left or right.
In a sense, this task was solved in three subsequent steps. The first step was to turn the lights on by hardcoding them. The second was to activate the buttons and connect them to the lights through simple(and inefficient) polling. The third step was to arrange for the buttons to work by way of interrupts and altering the code so that it would adhere to the assignment text in terms of keeping the LED-switching in the main-loop.

There was however, another, slightly more peripherally given task. Namely to make the code energy efficient.
