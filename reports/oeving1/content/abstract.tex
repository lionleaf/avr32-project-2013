The purpose of this assignment was to create an assembly program that would turn on the central LED on a given microcontroller, and then allow a user to move the light either left or right.

This was an introduction to the architecture and general workings of the AVR32 processor, the STK1000 development board and the AT32AP7000 microcontroller, as well as the principles behind and usage of hardware components, parallel I/O, interrupts, debouncing, energy efficiency and debugging.

The exercise was approached by first reading up on the technical documentation of the instruments and tools, and then dividing the assembly programming up into smaller incremental subtasks.

In the end the final program worked well and according to specifications.
